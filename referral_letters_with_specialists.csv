He has no history of diabetes and has never been hospitalized.  He has a history of chronic kidney disease which can be treated with medications.  He is also the only patient to have received a diagnosis of kidney disease at the time of his death. However, in his case the diagnosis was to have an endocrinologic diagnosis of diabetes.  If the diagnosis is the endocrinologic diagnosis, then his body is in a worse condition - he is very ill and needs to be hospitalized and undergo surgery to remove the endocrine.  This could explain why he was so ill when he had surgery to remove the endocrine.

Dear Oncologist,

RE: Wendy Thomas

She had been diagnosed with metastatic myeloma in the late 20th century, and her tumors were so severe that she has had to be hospitalized for nearly a year and a half for recurrence of her cancer.  It was on her second try that Wendy was diagnosed.  She had an advanced lung cancer and was unable to survive her chemotherapy and radiation regimen.  She lost her ability to breathe and had to go to the emergency room.  She needed a transplant and has been receiving chemotherapy for about a year.  That's when she discovered a new cancer cell.  She is now in remission and can continue chemotherapy
